Given a .txt file that has a list of a bunch of names, 
count how many of each name there are in the file, 
and print out the results to the screen.

counter = {}
with open('Training_01.txt') as open_file:
    line = open_file.readline()
    while line:
        line = line[3:-26]
        if line in counter:
            counter[line] += 1
        else:
            counter[line] = 1
        line = open_file.readline()

print(counter)

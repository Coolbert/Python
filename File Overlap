Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. 
One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

primes = []
with open('primenumbers.txt') as a:
    prime = a.readline()
    while prime:
        primes.append(int(prime))
        prime = a.readline()
happies = []
with open('happynumbers.txt') as b:
    happy = b.readline()
    while happy:
        happies.append(int(happy))
        happy = b.readline()
common = []
for same in primes:
    if same in happies:
        common.append(same)
print(common)

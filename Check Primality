Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.

b = []
num = int(input("Give number: "))
divisors = list(range(2,int(num/2)))
for a in divisors:
    if num % a == 0:
        b.append(a)

if len(b) == 0:
    print("Number is prime.")
else:
    print("Number is not prime.")

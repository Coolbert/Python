Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). 
Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.

import random

a = random.randint(1,9)
decide = ''
num = 0
counter = 0

while num != a and decide != "exit":
    num = int(input("Guess the number: "))

    counter += 1

    if num > a:
        print("Number is too high.")
    elif num < a:
        print("Number is too low.")
    else:
        print("Number is accurate.")
        print("You got this in " + str(counter) + " tries.")
        break

    decide = input("Do you wanna try? If not type exit, if yes press any key!")
    if decide == "exit":
        print("You gave up.")

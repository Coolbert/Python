Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) 
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
For practice, write this code inside a function.

def first_and_last (tab):
    return [tab[0],tab[len(tab)-1]]

a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
b = first_and_last(a)
print(b)

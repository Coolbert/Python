Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list 
that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

Loop version:

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
c = []

for num in a:
    if num in a and num not in c:
        c.append(num)

print(c)

Set version:

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
c = []

for num in a:
    c = set(a)

print(c)

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). 
If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

number = int(input("Give me a number: "))
check = int(input("Give me checker: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Number is even")
else:
    print("Number is odd")
if number % 4 == 0:
    print("Number is divided by 4")
if number % check == 0:
    print("This number is also divided by " + str(check))
else:
    print("This number is not divided by " + str(check))

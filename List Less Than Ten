Take a list, say for example this one:
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements 
from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
c = []

level = int(input ("Give number which is max for new list: "))
for b in a:
    if b < level:
        c.append(b)
print(c)
